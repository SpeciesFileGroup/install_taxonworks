# Development quick start

You can quickly start developing or testing against the API with minimal configuration.  The following assumes you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and its dependencies installed and running, and, presently, an up to date version of [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

* `git clone https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.git` - to clone repository in directory of your choice
* `cd taxonworks`
* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up`
*  browse to `127.0.0.1:3000` if you can see something similar to below in your terminal window:
    ```
    webpack_1  | webpack: Compiled successfully.
    ```
* You should see the logon window. Minimally, you now need to _Create a user_ or _Restore a database dump_
* Wait for a while if the logon window does not load not load quickly. 
* Use `ctrl-c` or `docker-compose down` in another local terminal to shutdown

# Overview
* See [documentation for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
* In TaxonWorks `docker-compose` is configured to use  [Dockerfile.development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/development/Dockerfile.development)
* Commands in following sections assume you are running `docker-compose up` in another terminal.

## Shell into the app

* `docker-compose exec app bash`

## Create a user

Assumes you want an otherwise empty database/application. See next section if you are looking for seeding the DB with pre-made data.

* Shell into the app 
* `bundle exec rails c`
*  `User.create!(name: 'you', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password', self_created: true, is_administrator: true, email: 'user@example.com')`
* `quit`

## Database seed

To seed the database use `docker-compose exec app bundle exec rails db:seed` (if you are already in app shell then `bundle exec rails db:seed`). This includes an admin and a non-admin user, which are `admin@example.com` and `user@example.com` respectively, both with password `taxonworks`.

## Develop!

* The container is mapped to the source on your local machine, what you see when you shell into the app is what is on your local file system.
* To make changes simply edit the source that you cloned.
* Changes are automatically applied and visible in the browser as they would be for the native environment.
* In most cases you need not restart the server or redo `docker-compose up`. 
* See the Rails documentation for more.

## Use a debugger like byebug or pry

Two steps. Run docker-compose in daemon mode, then attach to the app. Server log/debugger entry point will appear in the window after requests.

* `docker-compose up -d` (If you are already running `docker-compose up` stop it first)
* `docker attach taxonworks_app_1` (Container name can be found with `docker ps`, but if app is running on taxonworks directory `taxonworks_app_1` is likely correct)

## Stop a container

Get the container id from `docker ps`

* `docker stop 3dc4293eg17e`  

# Database

The database persists across use.  By default it is *not* the same as database described in the "native" environment approach.

## Drop and recreate the database to an empty state

* Ensure the app is not running (you may stop it with `docker-compose stop app`), the database container needs to be running.
* `docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres`
* `drop database taxonworks_development;`
* `create database taxonworks_development;`
* `\q`
* You may restart taxonworks now with `docker-compose start app`

## Restore a database dump

Assumes you have a prior export generated by `rake tw:db:dump`

* Drop and recreate the database to an empty state
* `docker-compose exec db -T pg_restore -U postgres -d taxonworks_development < /path/to/pg_dump.dump`
* Depending on when the database was dumped restore errors about roles can be ignored, i.e. the process will "fail" but be successful.
* You may restart taxonworks now with `docker-compose start app`

# Troubleshooting

## docker & docker-compose show permission errors (Linux users)
To fix this you may follow [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), or use `sudo` on `docker` and `docker-compose` commands.

## "docker-compose build" fails

### With a missmatched Ruby version
* Ensure your `ruby -v` version matches the version in the [`Gemfile`](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/blob/development/Gemfile#L5).  You may need to update or install a new Ruby.

### `docker-compose build` fails after `RUN apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng`

* Problem: It seems that sometimes the repository list update fails because of bad(?) internet connection. Difficult to replicate. 
* Solution: Do nothing, just re-run `docker-compose build` again.

## "docker-compose up" fails

### Migration related error
* Problem: Active Migration related error is observed in client browser after following installation process.
* Solution: The problem is patched in latest version, if you're still observing it after updating local TaxonWorks repository,  re-open this [issue](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues/250) with your problem.

### With PG::ConnectionBad: could not connect to server
* Problem: Likely you have `config/database.yml` already set up for your native local server or some other location that is not available
* Solution: You can remove `config/database.yml` and let the startup process reconstruct it or make sure config for development environment is the same as `config/database.yml.docker.compose.example`

### With "A server is already running"
* If an app container is not shut down correctly (`docker-compose down`) it can leave the file `tmp/server.pid`
* On the _local_ file system check to see if `/app/tmp/pids/server.pid` exists, if it does, delete it.

### With `(Bundler::GemNotFound)` or Log reports `Gem not found`
* Bring down the containers `docker-compose down`
* Redo the build step `docker-compose build`

## Windows related

* You may need to use `localhost` rather than `0.0.0.0` where applicable in database calls.

## Cleanup old containers

*  Try `docker images` and `docker rmi <id>` to cleanup old images.
