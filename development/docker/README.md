# Docker development environment for TaxonWorks

## Quick start

You can quickly start developing or testing against the API with minimal configuration. The following assumes you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and its dependencies installed and running. If using Docker Desktop for MacOS/Windows we **strongly** suggest to increase memory to *at least* 4GB under "Resources" section in settings (you may not want to assign more than half of your system RAM).

* If using MacOS/OSX Install XCode tools
* `git clone https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.git` - to clone repository in directory of your choice
* `cd taxonworks`
* `docker-compose build --pull`
* `docker-compose up`
*  browse to `127.0.0.1:3000` if you can see something similar to below in your terminal window:
    ```
    webpack_1  | webpack: Compiled successfully.
    ```
* You should see the logon window. 
* Wait for a while if the logon window does not load not load quickly. 
* Use `ctrl-c` or `docker-compose down` in another local terminal to shutdown

### Next steps

* Minimally, you now need to [Create a user from the console](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_doc/blob/archive/development/HOW-TO.md#create-a-user-from-the-console) or [Seed a project, users, and some data from the command line](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks_doc/blob/archive/development/HOW-TO.md#seed-a-project-users-and-some-data-from-the-command-line) or _Restore a database dump_ (see below)

* To run tests first setup the test database with `docker-compose exec app bundle exec rails db:test:prepare` and then run `docker-compose exec bundle exec rake`.
## Develop!

### Overview

* Commands in following sections assume you are running `docker-compose up` in another terminal.
* To make changes simply edit the TaxonWorks source that you cloned into your local directory
* Changes are automatically applied and visible in the browser as they would be for the native environment.
* In most cases you need not restart the server or redo `docker-compose up` to see your changes, though there are some cases in which you will.

### More on Docker

* In TaxonWorks `docker-compose` is configured to use  [Dockerfile.development](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/development/Dockerfile.development)
* The container is mapped to the source on your local machine, what you see when you shell into the app is what is on your local file system.
* See [documentation for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

### Use a debugger like byebug or pry

Two steps. Run docker-compose in daemon mode, then attach to the app. Server log/debugger entry point will appear in the window after requests.

* `docker-compose up -d` (If you are already running `docker-compose up` stop it first)
* `docker attach taxonworks_app_1` (Container name can be found with `docker ps`, but if app is running on taxonworks directory `taxonworks_app_1` is likely correct)

### Stop a container

Get the container id from `docker ps`

* `docker stop 3dc4293eg17e`  

## Database

The database persists across use (e.g. docker builds, up/down). By default it is *not* the same as database described in the "native" environment approach.

_TODO: move below to unified HOW TO in taxonworks_doc__

### Drop and recreate the database to an empty state

* Ensure the app is not running (you may stop it with `docker-compose stop app`), the database container needs to be running.
* `docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres`
* `drop database taxonworks_development;`
* `create database taxonworks_development;`
* `\q`
* You may restart taxonworks now with `docker-compose start app`

### Restore a database dump

Assumes you have a prior export generated by `rake tw:db:dump`

* Drop and recreate the database to an empty state
* `docker-compose exec db -T pg_restore -U postgres -d taxonworks_development < /path/to/pg_dump.dump`
* Depending on when the database was dumped restore errors about roles can be ignored, i.e. the process will "fail" but be successful.
* You may restart taxonworks now with `docker-compose start app`

## Troubleshooting

## docker & docker-compose show permission errors (Linux users)
To fix this you may follow [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/), or use `sudo` on `docker` and `docker-compose` commands.

### "docker-compose build" fails

### "docker-compose up" fails

#### Migration related error
* Problem: Active Migration related error is observed in client browser after following installation process.
* Solution: The problem is patched in latest version, if you're still observing it after updating local TaxonWorks repository,  re-open this [issue](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks/issues/250) with your problem.

#### With PG::ConnectionBad: could not connect to server
* Problem: Likely you have `config/database.yml` already set up for your native local server or some other location that is not available
* Solution: You can remove `config/database.yml` and let the startup process reconstruct it or make sure config for development environment is the same as `config/database.yml.docker.compose.example`

#### FATAL: database files are incompatible with server
* This may happen if you had used to have a running docker-compose environment with a taxonworks prior to 0.22.3. To fix this problem you'll need to execute `docker-compose down` (**DO NOT** add `--volumes` param). Then you can restart the environment as usual. You'll notice that data will be migrated from legacy Postgres 10 to 12.

#### With "A server is already running"
* If an app container is not shut down correctly (`docker-compose down`) it can leave the file `tmp/server.pid`
* On the _local_ file system check to see if `/app/tmp/pids/server.pid` exists, if it does, delete it.

#### With `(Bundler::GemNotFound)` or Log reports `Gem not found`
* Bring down the containers `docker-compose down`
* Redo the build step `docker-compose build`

### Windows related

* You may need to use `localhost` rather than `0.0.0.0` where applicable in database calls.

### Cleanup old containers

*  Try `docker images` and `docker rmi <id>` to cleanup old images.
