# Quickstart

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
* Clone the source code `git clone https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks.git`
* Follow the [instructions for using docker](docker/README.md).

# Development environments

* You want to maximize performance, and are OK with getting your hands dirty: Use a [native environment](native/README.md)
* You want to write code against the API, or make smaller changes: Use [Docker](docker/README.md)
* You want to use an Ubuntu virtual machine, with everything configured: Use a [virtual machine](vm/README.md) (more or less deprecated for the Docker approach, but still maintained)
